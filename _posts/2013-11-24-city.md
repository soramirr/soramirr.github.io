One of my first projects in my graphic design I class was to create a city in Adobe Illustrator using 1-point perspective. This project taught me not only about a new element of design, but also allowed me to expand my knowledge of Illustrator. I have since then used these skills to create much more in-depth works that better incorporate the elements of design. This was, however, an important part of the learning process.
