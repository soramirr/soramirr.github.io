This animation was created as a part of a larger animation, which was based on the childrens' story book "Little Red Flying Hood." This book was created by a man who has autism, but still keeps a wonderful imagination and graphics skills. My animation class reached out to him, and asked to adapt the book into a short animation. Since finishing this animation, it has recieved multiple awards. My contribution to the project as a whole can be viewed below.
