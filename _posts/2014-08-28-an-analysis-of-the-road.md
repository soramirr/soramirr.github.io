This was the first essay I wrote for my AP Language and Composition class. It was an analysis of The Road, and was assigned as my summer reading to prepare for the class. This essay created a benchmark for my starting position in the class, showing the teacher what I could do well and what I could not. The structure and flow of this work are needing improvement, and fail to contribute to the reader's experience. The diction, however, is much better. Careful choice of words gave this writing much more depth, in comparison to the other elements the piece. The syntax could also use some work, as it lacks proper variance.
