This is one of the first synthesis essays that I did. With the time limit that had become a standard by this time, it was rather difficult to create an essay in a format so new to me. This is apparent when looking at the end of the essay. There is no proper conclusion, but rather, it ends during a concession. This work does, however, show notable growth since the beginning of these timed essays. The elements of persuasion are much more apparent than before, as shown by the slightly improved use of sources and the use of a concession. Additionally, the thesis of this work is especially clear in its purpose, giving the reader a guide to how the rest of the work will flow. The diction and prose are still lacking, and fail to contribute to the work.
