This essay was amongst my first several in which I was given a time limit - and it shows. Its strongest point is its structure. Even though it only has three paragraphs, these paragraphs each have a clear meaning, and are able to contribute to the final product. While it does maintain a solid structure, the rest of the essay suffered as a cost.
The essay has no coherent flow, leaving the reader wondering where they are. Additionally, the example used is not explained until it has become mostly irrelevant. The essay's inconsistent diction leaves it with no clear tone, further confusing the reader.
