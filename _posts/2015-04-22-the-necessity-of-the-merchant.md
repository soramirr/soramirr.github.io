The focus of this essay was on qualifiers, or additions to statements to enhance their persuasive strength. These qualifiers are used to show the requirements and such of an event for the provided statment to be true. They act much like concessions, giving a small amount of ease to the opposing arguement where necessary. The use of these had a major impact on this essay, and showed me a method in which I may improve my persuasive abilities.
This work has a rather consistent prose, and the diction has improved since the previous works I have done. While they still need a lot of work, these skills are improving. The overall structure and flow are solid, however, and allow the reader to better understand what is going on in the writing and why everything is there.
