This project was a collaboration between myself and two others. The goal was to identify an issue in modern society and create a charity program to aid in that issue. My group created Octocare, a group which sells branded merchandise, carrying one or all of the mascots. The money raised by these sales would be given to studen hospitals to provide them with the materials that many of them lack. I created the mascots and sample merchandise alongside the main designer of the group, Alexander Higashi. Below you can see the final mascots.
